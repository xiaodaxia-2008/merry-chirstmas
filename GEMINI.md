# Project Overview

This is a simple, one-page website for Christmas. It displays a Christmas tree with animated, falling images. It also has an audio track that plays in the background, and a toggle to mute/unmute it. The background has an animated starfield. The images on the tree can be clicked to zoom in.

The page is responsive and uses `vh` units for sizing.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `css/style.css`: The stylesheet for the page.
*   `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file for the page.
*   `music/background.m4a`: The background music file.
*   `imgs/`: A directory containing the images used on the page.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions. The code is written in a straightforward manner.
